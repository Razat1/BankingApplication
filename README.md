# BankingApplication
Application consists of three types of accounts that can be created and accessed by customers through the bank teller. 
The bank teller is prompted to log in and ask customers questions whether they want to create or access their accounts. There is also a help option for the bank teller should they require it. 
Once the bank teller successfully checks what the customer would like to do, they are presented with another set of options. 
Within create account, the bank teller is prompted to ask customer which type of account they would like to create; Personal, ISA or Business. 
The Personal account prompts several questions the bank teller must ask the customer and input into the system.
Once all questions are answered, the customer is given a password along with the username they created. Their details are saved onto a file which can be used later if they want to access it. 
The ISA account similarly asks several questions the bank teller must ask the customer and input into the system along with confirming if the customer is satisfied with the additional requirements such as the account limitations and depending on their date of birth, the system calculates the age of the customer and accordingly shows which type of ISA is available for them to create. 
Within the business, similar type of questions are asked by the bank teller to the customer with also additonal limitations such as annual charges and to confirm which type of business the customer owns as certain types are not allowed. 

If the customer is an existing user, the bank teller will prompted to input the customer's account number and sort code which will then showcase another menu in which the bank teller asks whether the customer would like to view their balance, withdraw from their account, transfer to different account or deposit to their account.
The view option allows the bank teller to showcase to the customer their balance and account details.
Each of the other options asks for the amount the customer would like to withdraw, transfer or deposit. Additionally, in the transfer option, the customer is asked for their account number and sort code and then the account number and sort code for the account they want to transfer funds to. 
Lastly, the bank teller can exit the customer out their accounts without having to exit their own account in order to serve the next customer.
